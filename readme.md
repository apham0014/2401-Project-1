# Project 1
Our project should implement all the methods outlined in subsystem.h and in the brightspace spec, allowing for entries,removals,searches, etc relating to a system which contains a collection of subsystems. Our main function should prompt the user for input using switch case, and finally terminate when the user enters the approprate "exit" value. 

## Instructions for Building and Running 
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the appropriate folder containing the program's files.
2. Enter 'gcc -o p1 main.c subsys.c subsys_collection.c'
3. Then enter './p1'
4. My program will then prompt you for user input, so feel free to record/print/remove any subsys entries desired.
5. When you are satisfied, enter '0' and the program will terminate.
